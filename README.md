# TicTacToe- Haskell
A TicTacToe Game built with Haskell


## Steps on how to run the game locally
1 - The steps assume you have a compiler installed locally. If not please proceed to https://www.haskell.org/downloads/ and install the tools needed to run the script. <br/>
2 - Clone the repository. <br/>
3 - On your terminal navigate to the folder of the repository <br/>
4 - Run ghci to start the The Glasgow Haskell Compiler <br/> 
6 - Run :l tictactoe.hs to compile the file <br/> 
7 - Run main to start the game. <br/>

Have Fun! 


## Cibelle's MVP

1 - Neeeds to be written in Haskell <br/> 
2 - When script starts users can choose to start or quit the game at any time <br/>
3 - A visual representation of the board is displayed in the CLI <br/>
4 - Only create a new board if the player choose a position that was not yet taken <br/>
5 - User is made aware if the position they are trying to choose is not available  <br/>
6 - User knows whose turn is it <br/>


## Future implementations : 
1 - A game setup where users can enter their name  <br/>
2 - A score table that keeps track of winners/loosers <br/>
3 - Refactoring. Get rid of redudand code. Make it cleaner. <br/>



## Visual Demo


Any suggesctions on How I can improve the game or/and my code? Let me know. <br/> 
This is my first attempting writing in Haskell. The goal of this exercise is to learn about a different Programming Language Paradigm.<br/>
