# TicTacToe- Haskell
A TicTacToe Game built with Haskell


# Steps on how to run the game locally
1 - The steps assume you have a compiler installed locally. If not please proceed to https://www.haskell.org/downloads/ and install the tools needed to run the script.
2 - Clone the repository.
3 - Open command prompt and navigate to the folder of the repo 
4 - Run ghci to start the The Glasgow Haskell Compiler
6 - Run :l tictactoe.hs to compile the file
7 - Run main to start the game. 

Have Fun! 


Any suggesctions on How I  can improve the game and my code?Let me know.
This is my first attempting writing in Haskell. The goal of this exercise is to learn about a different Programming Language Paradigm.
