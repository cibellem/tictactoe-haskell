## ðŸ‘¾ ðŸ‘¾ A TicTacToe Game built with Haskell ðŸ‘¾ ðŸ‘¾

### Steps on how to run the game locally
1 - The steps assume you have a compiler installed locally. If not please proceed to https://www.haskell.org/downloads/ and install the tools needed to run the script. <br/>
2 - Clone the repository. <br/>
3 - On your terminal navigate to the folder of the repository <br/>
4 - Run ghci to start The Glasgow Haskell Compiler <br/>
6 - Run:l tictactoe.hs to compile the file <br/>
7 - Run main to start the game. <br/>
Have Fun!<br/>

## Cibelle's MVP
1 - Needs to be written in Haskell <br/> 
2 - A visual representation of the board is displayed in the CLI <br/>
3 - Only create a new board if the player chooses a position that was not yet taken <br/>
4 - User is made aware of the position they are trying to choose is not available <br/>
5 - User knows whose turn is it<br/>

## Future implementations :
1 - A game setup where users can enter their name <br/>
2 - A score table that keeps track of winners/losers<br/> 
3 - Refactoring. Get rid of redundant code. Make it cleaner.<br/>

## Notes
Any suggestions on How I can improve the game or/and my code? Let me know. <br/> 
This is my first attempting writing in Haskell. The goal of this exercise is to learn about a different Programming Language Paradigm. <br/>
